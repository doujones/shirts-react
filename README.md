Shirts and Refactoring React Code from a React Site

Phase 1: I'll create a login/registration box using ReactStrap or React Bootstrap for layouts

Phase: 2: I'll create the Front End using React, by using my knowledge and good sources that I have found on the internet.

Phase 3: I'll create the backend using Nodejs, MongoDB, Express by using my knowledge and good sources that I have found on the internet.

Phase 4: Good back to refactor coding to deploy clean coding.
